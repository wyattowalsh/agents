    "Agent dispatches to the full orchestration guide due to empty arguments after the skill name",
    "Agent applies the Decomposition Gate (Section 0) to the current request context",
    "Agent performs all 6 gate steps: DECOMPOSE actions, CLASSIFY independent vs dependent, MAXIMIZE parallelism opportunities, CONFLICT CHECK for same-file edits, DISPATCH via Pattern E (teams + nested waves) by default, TRACK via TaskCreate",
    "Agent identifies the fast path for single-action requests and skips to single session if applicable",
    "Agent identifies the explore-first path if decomposition requires exploration before classification",
    "Agent selects the highest applicable tier from the Tier Selection table (Team+waves > Subagent wave > Single session)",
    "Agent defaults to Pattern E (TeamCreate with nested subagent waves) as the dispatch target unless the task has exactly 1 action or is single-domain with no coordination needed"
