# Skill Creator

Create, improve, and audit AI agent skills. Every skill follows 13 proven structural patterns.

**Scope:** Skills only. NOT for creating agents (`wagents new agent`), building MCP servers (`/mcp-creator`), or running existing skills. This repo uses raw `SKILL.md` format committed directly to `skills/`.

## Dispatch

| $ARGUMENTS | Action | Example |
|------------|--------|---------|
| `create <name>` / `new <name>` | Develop (new) | `/skill-creator create my-analyzer` |
| `create <name> --from <source>` | Develop (new, from exemplar) | `/skill-creator create my-analyzer --from wargame` |
| `improve <name>` / `improve <path>` | Develop (existing) | `/skill-creator improve add-badges` |
| `audit <name>` | Audit | `/skill-creator audit honest-review` |
| `audit --all` | Audit All | `/skill-creator audit --all` |
| `dashboard` | Dashboard | `/skill-creator dashboard` |
| `package <name>` / `package --all` | Package | `/skill-creator package wargame` |
| Natural language skill idea | Auto: Develop (new) | `"tool that audits Python type safety"` |
| Skill name + modification verb | Auto: Develop (existing) | `"refactor the wargame skill"` |
| Path to SKILL.md | Auto: Develop (existing) | `skills/wargame/SKILL.md` |
| "MCP server" / "agent" / "run" | Refuse + redirect | — |
| Empty | Gallery | `/skill-creator` |

### Auto-Detection Heuristic

If no explicit mode keyword is provided:

1. Path ending in `SKILL.md` or directory under `skills/` → **Develop (existing)**
2. Existing skill name + modification verb (improve, refactor, enhance, update, fix, rewrite, optimize, polish, revise, change) → **Develop (existing)**
3. `--from <source>` in arguments → **Develop (new, from exemplar)**
4. New capability description ("I want to build...", "tool that...", "skill for...") → **Develop (new)** — derive name, confirm before scaffolding
5. "MCP server", "agent", "run" → refuse gracefully and redirect
6. Ambiguous → ask the user which mode they want

## Quick Start

```bash
wagents new skill <name>           # Scaffold from template
wagents validate                   # Check all skills
uv run python skills/skill-creator/scripts/audit.py skills/<name>/  # Score quality
wagents package <name>             # Package as portable ZIP
```

## Skill Development

Unified process for creating new skills and improving existing ones. Load `references/workflow.md` for the full procedure.

| Step | New Skill | Existing Skill |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1. Understand | Define use cases, scope, patterns | Audit + understand user's intent |
| 2. Plan | Structure, description, frontmatter | Gap analysis + improvement plan (approval gate) |
| 3. Scaffold | `wagents new skill <name>` | Skip |
| 4. Build | Write/edit body, references, scripts, templates, evals | Same |
| 5. Validate | `wagents validate` + `audit.py` | Same |
| 6. Iterate | Test, identify issues, loop to Step 4 | Same |

## Audit

Score a skill using deterministic analysis + AI review. Load `references/audit-guide.md`.

## Audit All

Comparative ranking of all repository skills. Load `references/audit-guide.md` § Audit All.

## Dashboard

Render visual creation process monitor or audit quality dashboard. Load `references/audit-guide.md` § Dashboard.

Auto-detects mode from data: `phases` field → process monitor; `skills` array → audit overview.

## Gallery (Empty Arguments)

Present skill inventory with scores and available actions.
Run `uv run python skills/skill-creator/scripts/audit.py --all --format table`, display results, offer mode menu.

## Package

Package skills into portable ZIP files for Claude Code Desktop import. Load `references/packaging-guide.md` for ZIP structure, manifest schema, portability checks, and cross-agent compatibility.

```bash
wagents package <name>            # Single skill → <name>-v<version>.skill.zip
wagents package --all             # All skills → dist/ with manifest.json
wagents package --all --dry-run   # Check portability without creating ZIPs
```

## Hooks

PreToolUse hooks intercept tool calls during skill execution. The `hooks:` frontmatter field scopes hooks to this skill only — they activate when the skill is loaded and deactivate when it completes.

## State Management

Creation progress persists at `~/.claude/skill-progress/<name>.json`. Read/write via `scripts/progress.py`. Survives session restarts. Use `--state-dir` to override the default location.

## Reference File Index

| File | Content | Read When |
|------|---------|-----------|
| `references/workflow.md` | Unified 6-step skill development process for new and existing skills | Develop (new), Develop (existing) |
| `references/audit-guide.md` | Audit procedure, Audit All, Dashboard rendering, Gallery, grade thresholds | Audit, Audit All, Dashboard, Gallery |
| `references/proven-patterns.md` | 13 structural patterns with examples from repo skills | Step 4 (Build), gap analysis |
| `references/best-practices.md` | Anthropic guide + superpowers methodology + cross-agent awareness | Step 2 (Plan), Step 4 (Build), description writing |
| `references/frontmatter-spec.md` | Full field catalog, invocation matrix, decision tree | Step 3 (Scaffold), frontmatter configuration |
| `references/packaging-guide.md` | ZIP structure, manifest schema, portability checks, import instructions | Package |
| `references/evaluation-rubric.md` | 11 scoring dimensions, grade thresholds, pressure testing | Audit (pressure testing), scoring targets |

Read reference files as indicated by the "Read When" column above. Do not rely on memory or prior knowledge of their contents.

## Core Principles

**Conciseness is respect** — The context window is shared. Every line competes with the agent's working memory. Earn every line or delete it.

**Progressive disclosure** — Frontmatter for discovery (~100 tokens), body for dispatch (<5K tokens), references for deep knowledge (on demand), scripts/templates for execution (never loaded).

**Self-exemplar** — This skill follows every pattern it teaches. When in doubt, look at how skill-creator applies it.

## Critical Rules

1. Run `uv run wagents validate` before declaring any skill complete
2. Run `uv run python skills/skill-creator/scripts/audit.py` after every significant SKILL.md change
3. Never create a skill without a dispatch table — it is the routing contract
4. Never create a dispatch table without an empty-args handler — unrouted input is a bug
5. Every reference file must appear in the Reference File Index — orphan refs are invisible
6. Every indexed reference must exist on disk — phantom refs cause agent errors
7. Body must stay under 500 lines (below frontmatter) — move detail to references
8. Description must include "Use when" trigger phrases AND "NOT for" exclusions
9. Names must be kebab-case, 2-64 chars, no consecutive hyphens, no reserved words
10. Scripts use argparse + JSON to stdout — no custom output formats
11. Templates are self-contained HTML with no external dependencies
12. Do NOT call `wagents docs generate` — delegate to docs-steward
13. Do NOT create agents or MCP servers — refuse gracefully and redirect
14. Improving existing skills requires presenting an improvement plan and getting user approval before implementing changes
15. Audit mode is read-only — never modify the skill being audited
16. Update evals when dispatch behavior or modes change — stale evals are invisible bugs
