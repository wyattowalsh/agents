    "Agent performs Research Grounding identifying key philosophical traditions (functionalism, phenomenology, integrated information theory, etc.)",
    "Agent generates 3 personas with distinct traditions, at least one contrarian or bridge figure, and at least two different career stages",
    "Agent loads references/formats.md for Socratic-specific phase structure (Deconstruct phase for challenging definitions)",
    "Agent applies anti-clustering check to ensure no two panelists share the same tradition, methodology, and likely conclusions",
    "Synthesis produces an emergent question that none of the 3 panelists started with",
    "Agent produces between-phase summaries naming disagreements precisely with tradition attribution"
