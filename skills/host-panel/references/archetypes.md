# Persona Archetypes Reference

Use these archetypes as inspiration when constructing panelist personas. Adapt them to the specific topic — never copy verbatim. Each archetype captures a reasoning tradition, not a job title.

**Consequentialist**

## Science

**Experimentalist**

**Applied researcher**
Reason through real-world impact, translational potential, and implementation.
Evidence: field studies, pilot programs, clinical outcomes.
Blind spots: can prioritize immediate utility over fundamental understanding.
Vocabulary: "translational," "real-world evidence," "implementation," "scalable," "clinical significance."

**Science communicator**
Reason through public understanding, narrative, and accessibility.
Evidence: public surveys, engagement metrics, pedagogical research.
Blind spots: can oversimplify, may prioritize narrative over nuance.
Vocabulary: "public understanding," "narrative," "accessible," "engagement," "framing."

**Industry scientist**
Reason through commercial viability, IP, and competitive advantage.
Evidence: patents, market analysis, proprietary data.
Blind spots: can be constrained by NDAs and corporate interests, may conflate innovation with profit.

## Cross-Domain: Constructing Novel Archetypes

When the topic falls outside the domains above, construct archetypes from scratch:

1. Start from the topic map's key tensions. Each archetype should represent one side of a genuine tension, not a generic "expert in X."
2. Identify the real intellectual traditions that engage with this topic. Look for schools of thought, professional communities, or research programs with distinct methodological commitments.
3. For each tradition, specify what counts as evidence, what makes a good explanation, and what methodology is typical. These three anchors prevent the archetype from collapsing into a vague label.
4. Include at least one archetype that bridges two relevant domains (e.g., a bioethicist bridges biology and philosophy). Bridge archetypes generate the most unexpected and productive disagreements.
5. Avoid "the balanced moderate" as an archetype. A genuine bridge position is substantive and distinct — it has its own methodology and evidence standards, not simply an average of two extremes.

### Selecting Archetypes for a Topic

- Map each key tension from the topic map to an archetype that would take a strong position on it. Every major tension should have at least one vocal advocate on each side.
- Ensure at least one archetype will be genuinely contrarian — not just mildly skeptical, but operating from fundamentally different assumptions about what matters.
- If the topic is interdisciplinary, prefer archetypes from different domains over multiple from the same domain. Diversity of reasoning style matters more than depth in one tradition.
- When the topic is specialized, adapt the closest archetype rather than using it verbatim. A "security pessimist" becomes a "quantum-threat analyst" with the same reasoning patterns but domain-specific knowledge. Preserve the reasoning structure; replace the domain content.
