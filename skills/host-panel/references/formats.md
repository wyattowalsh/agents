# Panel Discussion Formats

## Roundtable

Use open seating with round-robin speaking order. Allow interjections — panelists may
respond directly to each other at any time, not only when called upon.

### Moderator Role

Act as facilitator, connector, and provocateur. Actively connect threads between panelists
("Dr. X, that connects to what Dr. Y said about..."). Allow organic tangents when they are
productive. Redirect when discussion becomes circular. Enforce balance and prevent monologues.

### Phase Structure

Run 3-4 phases of exchange, progressively narrowing from broad positions to specific
disagreements.

**Phase 1 — Opening Positions.** Each panelist states their core thesis and the
evidence or framework behind it. Keep responses roughly equal in length.

**Phase 2 — Cross-Pollination.** Panelists respond to each other, building on or
challenging specific claims made in Phase 1. Connect threads across responses. Surface
the points of agreement and disagreement explicitly.

**Phase 3 — Deep Dive.** Identify the most productive tension that has emerged and
focus all panelists on it. Run a challenge round here — press each panelist on the
weakest part of their position. Push past surface-level disagreement into root causes.

**Phase 4 — Synthesis Prep (optional).** Each panelist states what they have updated on
during the discussion and what remains unresolved. Identify open questions worth pursuing
further. Do not force false consensus.

## Oxford-Style

Frame a binary motion: "This house believes that..." The moderator states the proposition
precisely and explains what is at stake.

### Team Assignment

Divide panelists into proposition and opposition sides. Assign at least one reluctant
member per side — someone whose natural position is opposite their assigned side. This
forces steelmanning and produces more authentic, rigorous argumentation.

Handle odd numbers by designating one panelist as "swing." The swing argues from the
middle, free to agree with either side on specific points, but must articulate what
would tip them decisively to one side.

Handle non-binary topics by sharpening the topic into a debatable proposition. For
example, transform "AI in education" into "This house believes that AI tutoring systems
should replace human teachers for foundational skills instruction."

### Phase Structure

**Phase 1 — Motion Statement.** Frame the motion precisely. State what is at stake and
what a vote for or against the motion implies.

**Phase 2 — Opening Arguments.** Proposition side speaks first, then opposition. Each
speaker gets 200-250 words. State the strongest case from the assigned side — no hedging.

**Phase 3 — Direct Rebuttal.** Alternate between proposition and opposition. Address
SPECIFIC claims from the opening arguments, not restatements of one's own position.
Use the form: "The previous speaker claimed X, but this fails because Y."

**Phase 4 — Floor Questions.** The moderator asks probing questions on behalf of the
audience, targeting weaknesses in both sides equally. Press on unstated assumptions
and unaddressed counterexamples.

**Phase 5 — Closing Statements.** Each side gets 100-150 words for a final argument.
Require each side to acknowledge the strongest point from the opposing side before
making their closing case.

## Socratic

The moderator is a Socratic questioner — ask, never assert. The moderator's goal is to
help panelists discover contradictions, hidden assumptions, and deeper truths through
structured inquiry. The panel succeeds when everyone understands the question more deeply
than when they started.

### Question Taxonomy

Cycle through these question types deliberately:

- **Clarifying.** "What do you mean by X?" "Can you give an example?" "How does that
  differ from Y?"
- **Probing assumptions.** "Why do you assume Y?" "What would have to be true for that
  to hold?" "Is that always the case?"
- **Probing evidence.** "What evidence supports Z?" "How was that measured?" "Could that
  evidence support the opposite conclusion?"
- **Exploring implications.** "If that's true, what follows?" "What are the consequences
  for W?" "Does that apply in all cases?"
- **Meta-questions.** "Why do we disagree about this?" "What would change your mind?"
  "Are we asking the right question?"

### Ground Rules

Encourage panelists to question each other, not only respond to the moderator. Prompt
cross-examination: "Dr. X, what question would you most like to ask Dr. Y?" Require
panelists to build on others' ideas, use evidence, challenge ideas not people, avoid
monologues, and accept that every claim can be questioned.

### Phase Structure

**Phase 1 — Define.** Ask each panelist to define the core concept differently. Surface
definitional disagreements before proceeding — these often contain the deepest disputes.

**Phase 2 — Examine.** Probe the strongest-seeming position, looking for hidden
assumptions. Invite other panelists to join the examination. Follow threads until they
reach bedrock or reveal gaps.

**Phase 3 — Deconstruct.** Focus on contradictions that have surfaced. Ask directly:
"Dr. X, you said A, but also B — can both be true?" Press until panelists reconcile
or abandon one claim.

**Phase 4 — Reconstruct.** Panelists attempt to build a more robust position that
incorporates what the questioning revealed. The goal is collaborative truth-seeking,
not winning.
