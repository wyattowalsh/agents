    "Agent applies four-lens analysis without modifying the prompt",
    "Agent identifies anti-patterns (likely: vague instructions, missing output format, no injection hardening)",
    "Agent does NOT propose or apply changes (report-only mode)",
    "Agent recommends full Analyze if fixes needed, and Mode D (Evaluate)"
