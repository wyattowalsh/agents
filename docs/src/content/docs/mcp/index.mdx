import { Card, CardGrid, Badge, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

> Hand-maintained catalog of MCP servers configured in this environment, organized by category.

<Badge text="31 configured servers" variant="note" size="large" />

<Aside type="tip" title="What is MCP?">
The [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard for connecting AI agents to external tools and data sources. Each server below exposes one or more tools that agents can invoke during a session.
</Aside>

<Aside type="note" title="Source of truth for this page">
This page is **hand-maintained** and currently summarizes the MCP server entries in the repository root `mcp.json`. That file includes a mix of local scripts, local packages, remote gateways, and third-party servers, so this list is broader than the repo-local `mcp/` directory.
