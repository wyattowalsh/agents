Skills are reusable knowledge and workflows that make AI coding agents dramatically more capable. They work across **Claude Code**, **Gemini CLI**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, and any [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io)-compatible agent.

Each skill packages domain expertise into a portable format: install once, invoke anywhere with `/skill-name`.

<div class="install-section">

### Quick Install All

```bash
npx skills add wyattowalsh/agents --all -g
```

</div>

<Aside type="tip" title="New to skills?">
Skills extend your AI agent with domain expertise, structured workflows, and proven patterns. Install with `npx skills add` and invoke with `/skill-name` in any supported agent. See [How it Works](/) for a quick overview, or browse the full [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) ecosystem.

## Understanding Skill Categories

This repository contains three categories of skills, each serving a different purpose:

| Category | Count | How they work |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| **User-Invocable** | 10 | You trigger these manually with `/skill-name`. They appear in the autocomplete menu. |
| **Convention** | 3 | The agent auto-invokes these when it detects relevant context (e.g., editing Python files). Hidden from the `/` menu. |
| **Installed** | 19 | Third-party skills installed from external sources via `~/.claude/skills/`. |

<Aside type="note" title="Generated docs vs hand-maintained guides">
Skill pages under `/skills/*` are generated from each skill's `SKILL.md`. If a deeper curated guide exists (for example, architecture or roadmap notes), the generated skill page links to it.

## User-Invocable Skills (10)

<Badge text="Manual invocation" variant="tip" /> Trigger these with `/skill-name` during a conversation. They appear in the autocomplete menu.

<div class="catalog-skill">

  <LinkCard title="add-badges" href="/skills/add-badges/" description="Scan a codebase to detect languages, frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, package managers, and tools, then generate and insert shields." />

</CardGrid>
</div>

## Convention Skills (3)

<Badge text="Auto-invoked" variant="caution" /> The agent loads these automatically when it detects relevant context -- no manual invocation needed. They enforce consistency across the codebase.

<div class="catalog-skill">
<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard title="agent-conventions" href="/skills/agent-conventions/" description="Agent definition conventions. Use when creating or modifying agents at any level (~/.claude/agents/, .claude/agents/, or project-local)." />
  <LinkCard title="javascript-conventions" href="/skills/javascript-conventions/" description="JavaScript/Node.js tooling conventions. Use when working on JS/TS files, package.json, or Node.js projects. Enforce pnpm for package management." />
  <LinkCard title="python-conventions" href="/skills/python-conventions/" description="Python tooling conventions. Use when working on .py files, pyproject.toml, or Python projects. Enforce uv for package management, ty for type checking." />
</CardGrid>
</div>

<Aside type="note" title="How convention skills work">
Convention skills set `user-invocable: false` in their frontmatter. This hides them from the `/` menu but keeps their descriptions in the agent's context, allowing automatic discovery and invocation when the agent encounters matching file types or patterns.
</Aside>

## Installed Skills (19)

<Badge text="External" variant="default" /> Third-party skills installed from the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) ecosystem via `npx skills add`. These live in `~/.claude/skills/` and are available across all your projects.

## Installing Individual Skills

You can also install specific skills rather than the full collection:

```bash
# Install a single skill globally
npx skills add wyattowalsh/agents --skill honest-review -g

# Install multiple specific skills
npx skills add wyattowalsh/agents --skill honest-review --skill wargame -g

# Install to a specific agent only
npx skills add wyattowalsh/agents --skill orchestrator -g -a claude-code
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Creating your own skills">
Want to build a custom skill? Use the [skill-creator](/skills/skill-creator/) to scaffold, develop, audit, and package skills following proven structural patterns. Or run `wagents new skill my-skill` from the [CLI](/cli/).
