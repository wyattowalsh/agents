## Skill Creator

Create, improve, and audit AI agent skills for this repository. Uses a unified 6-step development workflow that handles both new and existing skills, with mode-specific branching for the first three steps and identical build/validate/iterate phases for both.

### When to Use

- Building a new skill from scratch
- Refactoring or improving an existing skill's instructions
- Reviewing skill quality with a graded audit report
- Learning skill-writing patterns from concrete examples
- Comparing skill quality across the repository

<Aside type="caution">
NOT for running existing skills, creating agents (`wagents new agent`), or building MCP servers (`/mcp-creator`).
</Aside>

### Unified Development Workflow

| Step | New Skill | Existing Skill |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| 1. Understand | Define use cases, scope, patterns | Audit + understand user's intent |
| 2. Plan | Structure, description, frontmatter | Gap analysis + improvement plan (approval gate) |
| 3. Scaffold | `wagents new skill <name>` | Skip |
| 4. Build | Write/edit body, references, scripts, templates, evals | Same |
| 5. Validate | `wagents validate` + `audit.py` | Same |
| 6. Iterate | Test, identify issues, loop to Step 4 | Same |

### 13 Proven Patterns

The skill teaches and enforces structural patterns extracted from the repository's best skills:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Dispatch Table" icon="list-format">Routes `$ARGUMENTS` to modes with example invocations</Card>
  <Card title="Reference File Index" icon="document">Links reference files with "Read When" guidance</Card>
  <Card title="Critical Rules" icon="warning">Numbered, testable rules (5+ minimum)</Card>
  <Card title="Canonical Vocabulary" icon="translate">Exact terms for modes, grades, patterns</Card>
  <Card title="Scope Boundaries" icon="close">IS for / NOT for prevents misrouting</Card>
  <Card title="Progressive Disclosure" icon="layers">Frontmatter, body, references, scripts</Card>
</CardGrid>

Plus: classification-gating, scaling-strategy, state-management, scripts, templates, hooks, body-substitutions.

### Audit Script

The deterministic audit script scores skills across 10 weighted dimensions:

```bash
# Audit a single skill
uv run python skills/skill-creator/scripts/audit.py skills/<name>/

# Audit all skills with comparative table
uv run python skills/skill-creator/scripts/audit.py --all --format table
```

**Grade scale:** A (90+), B (75-89), C (60-74), D (40-59), F (<40)
