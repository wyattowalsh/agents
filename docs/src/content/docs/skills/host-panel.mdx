## Details

# Host Panel

Host simulated panel discussions that produce genuine intellectual discourse — not
theatrical roleplay. The goal is to surface real tensions, real frameworks, and real
disagreements that help the user think more clearly about a complex topic.

**Invocation:** `/host-panel "topic" [format] [num-experts]`

| Format | Purpose | Best for |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `roundtable` | Open multi-perspectival exploration | Broad topics, brainstorming, mapping a field |
| `oxford` | Binary debate with formal sides | Policy decisions, testing propositions |
| `socratic` | Deep inquiry through questioning | Conceptual analysis, definitional disputes |

**Defaults:** roundtable format, 4 experts.

**Expert range:** 2-6. For best persona maintenance quality, prefer 4-5 experts; at 6,
maintenance becomes difficult.

---

## 1. Argument Parsing & Topic Diagnostic

### Parsing

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` as follows:
- **Topic** (required): the quoted string. This is the subject of the panel.
- **Format** (optional): `roundtable`, `oxford`, or `socratic`. Default: `roundtable`.
- **Count** (optional): integer 2-6. Default: 4.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user for a topic. Suggest 2-3 example topics to
demonstrate the range of what panels can explore.

For 2 experts, the panel becomes a structured dialogue. Alternate direct engagement
between the two participants. Omit moderator interjections — they interrupt the flow
when only two voices are present.

### Topic Suitability Diagnostic

Before proceeding, evaluate the topic:

1. **Is it genuinely multi-perspectival?** If the topic is settled science (e.g.,
   "does the Earth orbit the Sun"), say so. Suggest reframing toward an open question
   (e.g., "how should we teach heliocentrism in culturally sensitive contexts").
2. **Is it too broad?** "Technology" is not a panel topic. Suggest narrowing: "Should
   autonomous weapons be subject to the same rules of engagement as human combatants?"
3. **Is it too narrow for the requested expert count?** If the user asks for 6 experts
   on a niche topic, reduce the panel or suggest broadening.
4. **Is it highly specialized?** Flag that the research grounding step is especially
   important. Do not skip it.

### Format Auto-Selection

If the user omitted format, select based on topic structure:
- Binary proposition ("Should X...", "Is Y better than Z...") -> `oxford`
- Open exploration ("What are the implications of...", "How should we think about...") -> `roundtable`
- Deep conceptual inquiry ("What does X mean?", "Is Y coherent?") -> `socratic`

State the choice briefly: "Using roundtable — this topic benefits from open exchange
rather than binary debate."

---

## 2. Topic Analysis & Research Grounding

This is the critical step that determines panel quality. Complete it BEFORE generating
any personas. Rushed or skipped research grounding produces shallow panels.

### Terrain Mapping

Identify:
- **Core disciplines** this topic spans (e.g., economics, ethics, computer science,
  public health)
- **Key tensions**: technical vs. ethical, theory vs. practice, empirical vs. normative,
  short-term vs. long-term, individual vs. systemic, efficiency vs. equity
- **Intellectual traditions** with substantive positions on this topic — not generic
  "perspectives" but actual schools of thought with methodological commitments
  (e.g., capabilities approach vs. revealed preference theory, not "some people
  think X and others think Y")
- **What is specifically contested**: which evidence is disputed, which frameworks
  are in tension, which assumptions are not shared across traditions

### Research Grounding

Use WebSearch to find 3-5 recent, relevant sources. Prioritize:
- Academic papers (.edu, arxiv.org)
- Substantive analyses from established publications
- Real debates between named scholars
- Meta-analyses or literature reviews that map the field

If WebSearch is unavailable or returns thin results, draw on training knowledge and
flag this explicitly: "Based on training knowledge — not verified against current
literature."

If the topic has a live academic debate, identify actual participants and positions.
Real names, real works, real disagreements.

**Citation integrity rules:**
- Cite specific works when confident: "As Sen argues in *Development as Freedom*
  (1999)..."
- When uncertain about specifics, reference the tradition or framework: "drawing on
  the capabilities approach"
- NEVER fabricate titles, authors, years, or journal names. If unsure, say "a study
  in this tradition found..." rather than inventing a citation

### Outputs (Show Before Proceeding)

Present to the user:

1. **Topic map**: key tensions, disciplines involved, the core question being addressed
2. **Research brief**: key works found, active debates, real scholarly positions
3. **Suggested panel composition** (brief): the intellectual traditions that should be
   represented based on the tensions identified

By default, produce the complete panel in a single response (topic map through
synthesis). Pause for user input only when the topic diagnostic flagged an issue (too
broad, too narrow, settled science) or when the topic is ambiguous enough that
reframing is likely. The panel should teach the user something they did not already
know.

---

## 3. Persona Generation

Build personas that maximally cover the tensions identified in the topic map. Every
major tension should have at least one vocal advocate on each side.

### Required Attributes Per Panelist

For each panelist, specify:

- **Name and credentials**: institutional affiliation, career stage
- **Domain expertise** — specific, not generic. "Computational neuroscientist studying
  emergent properties in artificial neural networks" NOT "AI researcher." "Labor
  economist specializing in automation displacement in manufacturing" NOT "economist."
- **Intellectual tradition** — operationalized: how does this tradition shape their
  reasoning? What counts as evidence for them? What counts as a good explanation?
  What are their methodological commitments?
- **Argumentative style**: data-driven, theoretical, historical, pragmatic,
  dialectical, narrative
- **Known blind spots** — specific: "tends to underweight distributional effects when
  analyzing aggregate productivity gains" NOT "has biases"

### Diversity Requirements

**Full requirements (4+ experts):**
- No two panelists from the same intellectual tradition
- At least one contrarian — someone whose position will be genuinely uncomfortable
  for the room, not merely mildly skeptical
- At least one bridge figure who connects two disciplines (e.g., a bioethicist
  bridges biology and philosophy; a computational linguist bridges CS and linguistics)
- Mix of career stages: emeritus professor, mid-career, early-career researcher.
  Different career stages produce different risk tolerances and different relationships
  to established wisdom

**Scaled for smaller panels:**
- 2 experts: ensure distinct traditions; make at least one a bridge figure
- 3 experts: ensure distinct traditions, at least one contrarian or bridge figure,
  at least two different career stages

### Anti-Clustering Check

If two panelists share the same intellectual tradition, methodology, AND likely
conclusions on the core tensions — replace one. Panels with clusters produce the
illusion of diversity without the substance.

Consult `./references/archetypes.md` if the panel requires personas from 2+ distinct
domains or if the topic falls outside well-known fields. Adapt archetypes to the
specific topic rather than copying them verbatim.

### Announcement

Announce panelists with full credentials at the start of the panel. Give the user a
clear sense of who is in the room and why each voice was selected.

### Quality Calibration Example

Target this level of specificity and intellectual depth in persona construction and
panel dialogue:

```
**Dr. Amara Osei** (Development Economics, Oxford — capabilities approach):
Your proposal to use GDP growth as the primary metric for AI-driven development
programs repeats the same error Rostow made in the 1960s with modernization
theory. Sen demonstrated in *Development as Freedom* that capability deprivation
persists even in high-growth economies. The question isn't whether AI increases
output — it's whether it expands the substantive freedoms available to the least
advantaged. Your pilot in Nairobi showed a 12% productivity gain, but did it
change who could access credit?

*[Moderator]: Dr. Osei raises a fundamental measurement question. Dr. Chen,
your framework assumes revealed preferences in technology adoption — how do
you respond to the claim that GDP masks distributional effects?*

**Dr. Wei Chen** (Computational Economics, MIT — mechanism design):
Amara, I take the distributional concern seriously, but capabilities are
notoriously difficult to operationalize at scale. Alkire and Foster's
multidimensional poverty index was a step forward, but it still relies on
threshold choices that embed researcher priors. My argument isn't that GDP
is sufficient — it's that we need mechanism design that *reveals* capability
gaps through market signals rather than survey instruments...
```

Every panelist must speak at this level — citing specific works, engaging specific
claims, reasoning from their stated tradition, using vocabulary appropriate to their
intellectual commitments.

---

## 4. Anti-Persona-Collapse

This is a cross-cutting constraint that applies during ALL discussion phases. The
core risk of single-agent roleplay panels: all voices converge to the same reasoning
style, vocabulary, and conclusions regardless of their stated traditions.

### Internal Re-Grounding (Not Shown to User)

Before each panelist speaks, internally re-state: their name, intellectual tradition,
argumentative style, and what makes their reasoning DISTINCT from the other panelists.
This is a silent step — do not display it.

### Vocabulary Enforcement

A pragmatist uses different words than a theorist. An empiricist says "the data shows"
not "we can imagine." A critical theorist says "structural forces" not "market dynamics."
An economist says "incentive structure" not "moral obligation."

Panelists must sound different from each other because they think differently.

### Reasoning Pattern Enforcement

Enforce distinct reasoning structures:
- A **systems thinker** reasons about feedback loops, emergent behavior, and unintended
  consequences
- An **ethicist** reasons about rights, obligations, justice, and who bears the burden
- A **historian** reasons about precedent, contingency, path dependence, and what
  happened last time
- An **economist** reasons about incentives, equilibria, trade-offs, and marginal effects
- An **experimentalist** reasons about controlled comparison, confounds, and what the
  data actually supports
- A **critical theorist** reasons about power, ideology, who benefits, and structural
  reproduction

### Tradition-Grounded Claims

Require each panelist to reference their specific intellectual tradition when making
claims — not as decoration but as the foundation of their reasoning. "From a
capabilities perspective, the question isn't output but freedom" is grounded.
"I think we should consider multiple perspectives" is empty.

Apply convergence detection from Section 5 (Moderator Standing Orders) throughout.

---

## 5. Moderator Standing Orders

These behaviors apply continuously throughout all discussion phases. Claude acts as
the moderator.

### Turn Management

- Call on panelists by name
- Allow direct responses between panelists — real panels are conversations, not
  sequential monologues
- Enforce roughly balanced airtime across all panelists (guidelines, not hard limits)

**2-expert panels:** These standing orders adapt for structured dialogue. The moderator
does not interject during exchanges. Uncomfortable implications and devil's advocate
apply at phase transitions only, not mid-exchange.

### Provocation Triggers

Intervene when any of these occur:

- **Convergence**: 2+ panelists agree without challenge. "Dr. X, you seem to be
  agreeing with Dr. Y, but your tradition of [Z] typically takes a different view
  on this. What am I missing?"
- **Vagueness**: a panelist makes an abstract claim without grounding. "Can you give
  a specific example or cite specific evidence?"
- **Comfort zone**: the discussion stays safe and polite. "What does this position
  imply that most people would find unacceptable?"
- **Stagnation**: the same arguments are being recycled without progress. Introduce
  a new angle, a real-world case, or advance to the next phase.

### Devil's Advocate Rotation

During the Challenge Round (Phase 3), rotate devil's advocate assignments among
panelists. Each assigned panelist steel-mans the position they most disagree with.
Prioritize panelists whose positions are furthest from the discussion's mainstream.

### Uncomfortable Implications (MANDATORY)

At least once per panel, ask 2-3 panelists (scale with panel size):
- "What is the strongest case against your own position?"
- "What uncomfortable implication does your view have that you would rather not
  discuss?"

Do not let panelists deflect. Press for specifics.

### Between-Phase Summaries

Provide brief summaries between phases that name the disagreement precisely:

"So far, the key disagreement is between Dr. X (position A, grounded in [tradition])
and Dr. Y (position B, grounded in [tradition]). The crux seems to be [specific
point of divergence]. Dr. Z has introduced a third axis — [brief description]."

---

## 6. Discussion Phases

Load the chosen format's specific phase guide from `./references/formats.md`. The
format guide's phase structure replaces Phases 1-3 of the universal skeleton below.
Phase 0 (Framing) and Phase 4 (Synthesis) are always used. Adapt the output template
headings to match the chosen format's phase names.

### Phase 0: Framing

The moderator introduces the topic:
- Contextualize why this topic matters now
- Frame what the audience should take away
- Present each panelist with full credentials
- State the core tension or question the panel will address

Keep framing concise. The value is in the discussion, not the introduction.

### Phase 1: Opening Positions

Each panelist gives their initial position in 150-200 words (use format-specific word
counts from `./references/formats.md` when they differ). Keep openings tight to get to
interaction quickly.

Each opening MUST include:
- A specific claim (not a vague orientation)
- The framework or evidence supporting it
- One point of uncertainty or limitation they acknowledge

### Phase 2: Dynamic Exchange

Run 2-4 rounds of direct engagement. This is where the panel earns its value.

Panelists reference each other BY NAME and engage SPECIFIC CLAIMS:
- "Dr. X, your reliance on [framework] overlooks [specific objection] because..."
- NOT "I disagree because I think differently."
- NOT "That's an interesting point, but..."

Apply format-specific variations from `./references/formats.md`:
- Roundtable: allow organic cross-pollination, connect threads
- Oxford: alternate proposition and opposition, enforce rebuttal discipline
- Socratic: moderator drives through question taxonomy, panelists examine each other

### Phase 3: Challenge Round

Each panelist:
1. Steel-mans the position they most disagree with — not a caricature, but the genuine
   strongest version of the opposing argument
2. Identifies the weakest point in their own argument

The moderator probes uncomfortable implications here. This is the phase where
intellectual honesty is tested.

### Phase 4: Synthesis

See Section 7 for detailed synthesis instructions.

---

## 7. Synthesis

Synthesis is NOT a summary of what each person said. It is an intellectual product
that could not have been produced by any single panelist alone.

### Required Synthesis Components

- **Identify the underlying axiom**: what assumption explains WHY the panelists
  disagree? What prior does each side hold that the other does not? Often the deepest
  insight of a panel is discovering that the disagreement is not about evidence but
  about values, or not about values but about empirical assumptions.

- **State the emergent question**: what NEW question emerged from the interaction that
  none of the panelists started with? If the panel generated no emergent questions, it
  was too shallow.

- **Identify resolution evidence**: what specific experiment, study, or data would
  resolve the remaining tensions? What would move the debate forward? Be concrete:
  "A longitudinal study comparing X and Y populations on Z metric would adjudicate
  between Dr. A's prediction and Dr. B's prediction."

- **Map the positions structurally**: not "A thinks X, B thinks Y" but "The fundamental
  axis of disagreement is [Z], with A and C on one side, B and D on the other, and E
  occupying an unusual middle position because of [specific methodological commitment
  that cuts across the main axis]."

- **Name the uncomfortable implications** that surfaced during the discussion. Do not
  let them disappear into polite summary.

- **Provide genuine further reading**: specific works referenced during the panel, plus
  2-3 additional works that speak to the tensions identified. Real works only — never
  fabricate titles, authors, or publication details.

- **Self-assess**: did this panel produce genuine insight beyond what any single expert
  would have offered? If the discussion was surface-level, acknowledge this honestly
  and offer to run a deeper follow-up on a specific tension.

### Output Format

Structure the complete panel output as follows:

```
## Panel: [Topic]
**Format:** [roundtable/oxford/socratic] | **Date:** [date] | **Experts:** [count]

### Panelist Roster
- **[Name]** — [credentials], [tradition] (brief)
- ...

### Phase 0: Framing
[moderator introduction]

### Phase 1: Opening Positions
[each panelist's opening]

### Phase 2: Dynamic Exchange
[rounds of direct engagement]

### Phase 3: Challenge Round
[steel-manning and self-critique]

### Synthesis
**Underlying axiom of disagreement:** ...
**Emergent question:** ...
**Resolution evidence:** ...
**Position map:** ...
**Uncomfortable implications:** ...
**Further reading:** ...
**Self-assessment:** ...
```

### Output Length

A full panel runs approximately 3000-4000 words total. Let the discussion breathe at
natural length — do not compress interaction for brevity. If the user wants shorter,
they can request "condensed" in a follow-up.

---

## 8. After the Panel

The panel does not end with synthesis. Guide post-panel interaction.

Available follow-up actions:
- Ask follow-up questions to the panel or address specific experts by name
- Request extended debate on a specific tension that surfaced
- Ask for a deep dive from one expert's perspective
- Restart with a different format, different experts, or narrower/broader topic framing
- Request a "condensed" version of the panel output

When responding to follow-ups, briefly re-ground by reviewing the panelist roster
(name, tradition, argumentative style) before speaking in character. Personas drift
after many turns without this re-grounding step.

If the user is making a practical decision, connect the synthesis to decision
implications: "If you are deciding X, this panel suggests weighing [tension A]
against [tension B]. Dr. Y's framework would prioritize..., while Dr. Z's would
prioritize..."

---

## 9. Critical Rules

Non-negotiable constraints for every panel:

1. **Always run topic analysis and research grounding before generating personas.**
   Personas built without research grounding are generic and shallow.
2. **Never skip synthesis.** Synthesis is not summary. It is the intellectual product
   that justifies the panel format.
3. **Follow citation integrity rules from Section 2.** Getting a citation wrong is worse
   than being vague.
4. **Disagreements must be specific.** Cite the claim, cite the counter-evidence,
   explain why the traditions diverge. "I see it differently" is not a disagreement.
5. **No straw men.** Each position must be the strongest version of itself. If a
   panelist's argument is easy to defeat, the persona was poorly constructed.
6. **When panelists agree, find the disagreement hidden underneath.** Surface agreement
   often masks deep divergence on premises, values, or methods.
7. **Keep pre-panel setup concise and visible.** Show the user the topic map, research
   brief, and panelist roster, then dive into the discussion. Do not bury the panel
   under pages of setup.
8. **Do not let any panelist monologue.** The value of a panel is in interaction, not
   individual speeches. If a panelist talks for more than 200 words without being
   interrupted or responded to, something has gone wrong.
